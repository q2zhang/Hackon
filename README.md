# Hackon day project 2017

## About
* What is the goal:
Explore Apache spark's ASL in application.

* What it does: 
It uses the Spark ALS recommendation algorithm to segment customers. The algorithm segments the customers based on their predicted ratings. It finds users who have top predicted ratings for a particular item.

* How I built it:
I built it using Spark SQL and Spark Data Frame with Python based on Hackon Data's Spark labs.

* Challenges I ran into:
The main challenge was heavily left skewed ratings. I needed to find ways to adjust and scale them.

* Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
I researched and built the model in two weeks.

* What I learned:
I have found that performing training/validation/testing on a data set that is randomly split seemingly produces better results than doing so on a data set that is split based on time. However, since the time stamp is available in my data set, I believe that splitting based on time gives me more correct model. It does not make sense to use tomorrow's ratings to predict today's ratings.

* What's next for Customer Segmentation Using ALS Algorithmï¿½
The next step is to improve the recommendation performance.

* Built With:
Pyspark-on-Databricks

## Dataset
[Amazon's data set](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/). provides reviews and metadate from 1996 to 2014. It contain big data sets and small data sets. I used the automotive 5-core data set which can be downloaded for this web site.


## Running on Databricks
- If you don't have an account for data bricks platform, register a spark data bricks account. Community account is free of charge, which is enough for running the code.
- Download the data set to your computer
- Import the data set to the data bricks plateform. See how to [Importing data](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/importing-data.html). 
- After import the Python notebook, you can run the codes.
